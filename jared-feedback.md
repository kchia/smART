No major code quality issues, makes use of JS best practices appropriately, and follows techniques such as separation of concerns, abstraction, and encapsulation

- Nice job separating out your files into models, views, and controllers!
- Make sure to remove any unused code from your HTML/JS/CSS files! There's some commented out code in some of your JS files that can be removed (e.g., https://github.com/jaredsmorgan/smART/blob/master/controllers/artists.js#L11).
