    "bio": "Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterized by bold colors and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness and poverty.",

    "bio": "Frida Kahlo was a Mexican painter known for her portraits, self-portraits, and paintings inspired by nature and Mexican culture. Her folk art style explored identity, gender, class, race, and post-colonialism. She often blended autobiographic elements with realism and fantasy—giving her marks as both a surrealist and magical realist. Though her work was exhibited in the late 1930s and 1940s, her work remained relatively unknown until the late 1970s when art historians and activists rediscovered it. She died shortly after her first solo exhibition in Mexico in 1953 after her health declined over the previous decade. She is now an icon for Chicanos, feminists, and the LGBT movements.",
